    Returns the full DataSage Context Pack as a JSON string.

    The Context Pack is the machine-readable semantic layer produced by
    DataSage's Business Analyst agent. It contains:
    - Business-language purpose for every table
    - Per-column meanings (what the column actually represents, not just its
      name and SQL type)
    - FK-backed relationships between tables
    - Ambiguity flags for columns that share a name across tables but mean
      completely different things (e.g. 'channel' in orders means sales
      channel; 'channel' in marketing_campaigns means marketing medium —
      no relationship between them)
    - Business value description per table

    Call this first before writing SQL or answering questions about the schema.
    Do not infer column meaning from names alone — the Context Pack has the
    correct interpretation already computed.

    Checks whether the live database schema matches the saved Context Pack.

    Compares the current DB structure against the schema snapshot that was

    - Tables added or removed since last scan
    - Column-level changes: new columns, dropped columns, type changes,
      nullability changes

    No LLM involved — this is a pure structural diff (set operations on table
    and column names). Returns "No schema drift detected" if nothing changed.

    Requires DB credentials to be present in the .env file in the repo root.
    Call this to verify the Context Pack is still current before trusting it.
