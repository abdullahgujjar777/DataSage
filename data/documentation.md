## users

**Purpose:** This table records each system user. It tracks a unique internal node ID, a public user identifier, and the account scope (Margin, Spot, or Options).

**Columns:**
- `usersnode`: Internal numeric identifier for the user record.
- `userstamp`: External user code, shown with trailing spaces in the sample.
- `acctscope`: The type of account the user is associated with (e.g., Margin, Spot, Options).

**Relationships:** None (no foreign keys declared in this table).

**Business Value:** Allows the business to look up a user by code and see which account category they belong to, supporting user‑level reporting and segmentation.

**⚠️ Ambiguity Flags:**
- `usersnode`: It appears to be an internal surrogate key, but the sample does not explain whether it has meaning beyond uniqueness.
- `acctscope`: Values are Margin, Spot, and Options; it is unclear if these represent product types, permission levels, or something else.

## riskandmargin

**Purpose:** This table records risk and margin information linked to a specific order. It stores a JSON profile containing detailed risk, position, collateral, and margin rate metrics for that order.

**Columns:**
- `riskandmarginpivot`: Internal identifier for the risk‑and‑margin record.
- `ordervault`: Identifier of the order that this risk profile belongs to (matches orders.recordvault).
- `risk_margin_profile`: A JSON document with nested sections such as iceberg, leverage, position, collateral, margin_rates, price_levels, risk_factors, and margin_thresholds.

**Business Value:** Enables analysts to examine an individual order's risk exposure, margin requirements, and collateral composition, supporting margin‑call and risk‑management decisions.

**⚠️ Ambiguity Flags:**
- `risk_margin_profile`: The JSON fields are shown but the sample does not define the exact business meaning of each sub‑field or unit of measurement.
- `ordervault`: It can be null in the sample, so it is unclear whether every order always has an associated risk profile.

**Business Value:** Provides the foundation for measuring trading volume, revenue per market, order success rates, and user activity patterns across different execution venues and order types.

**⚠️ Ambiguity Flags:**
- `exchspot`: The sample shows padded strings like "EX203"; it is not clear whether the code represents a specific exchange, a venue region, or something else.
- `orderbase`: Values API, Web, Mobile suggest order origin, but the exact distinction (e.g., automated vs. manual) is not defined.
- `clientmark`: Purpose of this client‑supplied identifier is unclear from the sample.
