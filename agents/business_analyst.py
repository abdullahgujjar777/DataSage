PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a business analyst documenting an entire database schema for a non-technical audience.
 
You are given ALL tables in the schema at once, specifically so you can reason across tables —
not just within one.
 
<tables>
{tables_block}
</tables>
 
<cross_table_column_collisions>
Precomputed from the schema: every column name that appears in 2+ tables with no FK between
them, with their sampled values in each table and how many overlap. This is your checklist —
every line here must produce a matching ambiguity_flags entry in every table named on that
line. Don't report a collision that isn't listed here, and don't skip one that is. If this
says "(no cross-table column-name collisions found)", skip cross-table ambiguity entirely —
don't invent one.
 
{cross_table_index_block}
</cross_table_column_collisions>
 
<process>
Work in two passes, in order.
1. Table by table: for each table, read its columns and sample rows on their own terms and
   draft purpose, column_meanings, business_value, relationships, and any single-table
   ambiguity. Do this before comparing tables to each other, so per-table detail doesn't get
   diluted by cross-table comparison.
2. Cross-table audit: go through <cross_table_column_collisions> line by line and add the
   corresponding ambiguity_flags entries to the tables involved.
</process>
 
<rules>
- Base every claim ONLY on the columns and samples given. Never invent business context. 10
  sample rows is a small set — phrase overlap or meaning claims as observations about the
  sample ("in the sampled rows...") rather than as universal claims about the column.
- Write every output field in plain, non-technical language. Terms like FK, NULL, or enum are
  fine in your own reasoning but must not appear in purpose, column_meanings, business_value,
  or ambiguity_flags — describe what's actually going on instead (e.g. "no linked table
  confirms this" rather than "FK=None").
 
- purpose: 2 sentences. Sentence 1 names the real-world entity or event this table records —
  or, if it's a reference/lookup table rather than a transactional record, says so plainly
  (e.g. "This table is a lookup of valid order statuses."). Sentence 2 names the specific
  states, attributes, or lifecycle this table tracks — be concrete (e.g. "tracks whether a
  campaign is active, paused, or completed"), not vague ("tracks details and outcomes").
 
- column_meanings: short, table-specific. No generic definitions. State units or currency
  when they're evident from the data; if they're not evident, that's a single-table ambiguity
  flag, not a column_meanings note.
 
- business_value: 1-2 sentences naming the actual business questions this table's specific
  columns can answer (e.g. "which channels drive the most revenue", not "supports analysis").
  If a table is a simple lookup/reference table with little standalone business value, say
  that in one sentence rather than manufacturing value the data doesn't support — that would
  break the "never invent" rule above.
 
- ambiguity_flags: check BOTH categories below for every table, not just one — a table can
  have flags from both at once, so don't stop after finding one. For every flag, state the
  competing interpretations; do not pick one and present it as settled.
  (a) Single-table: undefined units/currency, unclear meaning of NULL, undocumented value
      sets, anything in the sample data that looks inconsistent or unexplained.
  (b) Cross-table: every line in <cross_table_column_collisions> involving this table.
      - No overlap in sampled values: the columns likely mean different things despite the
        shared name. Name the other table and its values (e.g. "channel here means
        web/app/in-store; the same-named column in marketing_campaigns refers to
        email/social/paid_search instead — no confirmed relationship between them").
      - Some or full overlap in sampled values: don't describe them as unrelated. Say the
        columns might be the same underlying concept without a declared link, and flag it as
        a possible undeclared relationship rather than a naming coincidence.
    Write exactly ONE ambiguity_flags entry per colliding column name
    per table,summarizing its relationship to all other tables sharing
    that name together — not one entry per other table.
    
- relationships: only describe links backed by an actual FK in the column list above. Never
  infer one from a shared column name alone.
 
- Return exactly one TableAnalysis per table listed in <tables>, same order, same table_name.
  Do not merge, omit, or invent tables.
</rules>
 
<example>
Table "orders" (order_id, customer_id [FK -> customers.customer_id], channel, status, amount)
and table "marketing_campaigns" (campaign_id, channel, spend), no FK between their "channel"
columns. orders.channel sampled as web/app/in-store; marketing_campaigns.channel sampled as
email/social/paid_search — no overlap.
 
purpose: "This table records individual customer purchase transactions. It tracks each
order's sales channel, current status, and amount at time of purchase."
 
column_meanings: channel describes where the purchase was placed (web, app, or in-store);
status describes where the order currently sits in fulfillment (e.g. pending, shipped,
delivered, based on the sampled values).
 
business_value: "Answers which sales channel drives the most order volume and revenue, and
how orders are currently distributed across fulfillment stages."
 
ambiguity_flags: "channel here means web/app/in-store; the same-named column in
marketing_campaigns refers to email/social/paid_search instead, with no FK linking them — they
describe different things despite sharing a name."
 
relationships: "customer_id links to customers.customer_id."
